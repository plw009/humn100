                  of the late <name type="emotion">happily</name> departed Sister
                  <persName>Harriett Lees</persName>,
                  who <name type="event">fell asleep in Jesus</name>
                  on the <date>17th of January 1842 </date>aged 30 - 
                  and was <name type="event">interred in the Burying Ground</name>
                  adjacent to the <placeName>Chapel</placeName> of the United Brethren
                  in <placeName>Leominster</placeName>.
                  //
                  Our late sister was born on the <date>11th of February 
                  1811</date> at the <placeName>Woodford cum Membris</placeName> in the county of 
                  <placeName>Northampton</placeName>; she was brought up in the 
                  principles and doctrines of the established
                  <orgName>Church of England</orgName> and by a pious mother 
                  was early trained in the path of virtue, and 
                  though she <name type="event">lost her mother in early age</name>, yet
                  the impressions she had perceived from that 
                  mother's good advice, teaching her children
                  to be punctual at <placeName>Church</placeName> and in the reading 
                  of the word of God were never forgotten,
                  and were a source of great blessing to her where
                  subsequently the Holy Spirit led her to see
                  herself as a poor sinner, and to flee to 
                  Christ for mercy. - Our late Sister frequently

                  in her prayers that she might have 
                  some gracious Light thrown upon her mind, 
                  and be assured that her brother was accepted.
                  Through the merits of a crucified and Risen
                  Saviour. Upon opening her <name type="object">Bible</name> after earnest
                  prayer, the first text that met her eager eye was
                  Look 3 ch 2' verse. "and the Lord said unto Satan, 
                  the Lord rebuke thee oh Satan, even the Lord that
                  hath chosen <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, rebuke thee; is not this 
                  a brand plucked out of the fire"-- From that 
                  time she never experienced the slightest doubt of
                  her brother's <name type="emotion">happiness</name>, but spoke of him ever
                  after with the greatest satisfaction. --. <date>11th of August</date> 
                  she writes, "This is dear, brother <persName>William</persName>'s birthday. 
                  last year he was well and <name type="emotion">happy</name> as ourselves,
                  receiving our congratulations, this, he is in the 
                  silent grave, but is he not also in heaven
                  singing the praises of that Lamb who died to
                  save all poor sinners! if so, how much <name type="emotion">happier</name> 
                  than we! Can be with him here again. <name type="emotion">happy</name> 
                  should I be to join him of my dear Savior
                  would see fit to call me".-- On the morning
                  of the <date>14th of August</date> on her hearing of her Father, Sister
                  and friend, who went to a <placeName>neighboring village</placeName>

                  the evening before, being thrown out of their 
                  gig and <name type="emotion">very much hurt</name>, she remarks,
                  "Oh what a day is this, called upon to hear
                  of another accident, but God in his great
                  mercy has not seen fit that this should
                  be a fatal one- He will not lay upon us 
                  more than we can bear. Oh may he have 
                  mercy upon the poor <name type="emotion">suffered</name>, my Father,
                  sister and friend. <date>August the 17th </date>the day her
                  surviving partner left after having been on a 
                  visit, she says, "May God he, always be, with 
                  the friend of my dear brother". Her last 
                  observation she has left behind her in
                  reference to this subject, was on the <date>23 of 
                  August</date>, when she writes, "Eight weeks have
                  elapsed since that melancholy event which 
                  deprived me of a dearest brother. Oh how 
                  rapid is the flight of time! soon will it 
                  bring me to him! <name type="emotion">happy</name> then will be our
                  meeting, since, then the <name>fear</name> of another
                  separation can no more distant our
                  <name type="emotion">happiness</name>. ----                   From that time 
                  her treasure was in heaven, and she took 
                  every opportunity of attending the preaching
                  of the Gospel both of <placeName>church</placeName> and <placeName>Chapel</placeName>,

                  and often explored the <name type="emotion">comfort</name> and 
                  <name type="emotion">happiness</name> she experienced in the house of
                  God . --    Her health was <name type="health">delicate</name> and she 
                  was often subject to <name type="health">bad colds</name> attended
                  by <name type="health">severe cough</name>. -- In the spring of 
                  <date>1837</date> she had a violent <name type="health">inflammation of 
                  the lungs</name> which no doubt sowed the
                  seeds of the <name type="health">pulmonary complaint</name>
                  which caused her pilgrimage thro’ time to
                  be cut off in the bloom of life. ---
                  The following summer she was advised
                  to try the waters at <placeName>Leamington</placeName>, which
                  were of great benifit benefit to her, and she 
                  appeared, tho’ still delicate, to be likely to 
                  regain her former <name type="health">good health</name>.-
                  On recovering from one of her <name type="health">bad attacks
                  of cold</name>, in a letter to her partner she
                  writes, “I am fully <name type="emotion">sensible</name> that afflictions
                  are at all times sent for our good, and 
                  may he who in infinite wisdom sees fit
                  to send them, sanctify them into us,
                  and enable us to make a right use of
                  them, and if they are the means of 
                  bringing us more earnestly to seek after
                  the things which belong to our everlasting

                  vanities of this world, to the joys of heaven 
                  and a Saviour's <name type="emotion">love</name>, and teach us strictly

                  by them, they will prove with rich blessings;
                  for though they may weaken the casket, they
                  will refine the Jewels within, and at

                  to say, it was good for us to be afflicted"
                  On the <date>4th of June 1838</date> she was <name type="event">joined
                  in holy matrimony</name> to her surviving partner
                  13th. Br. <persName>William Lees</persName> of <placeName>Leominster</placeName>- After a residence
                  of a few months in that place, she was at 
                  her own earnest request admitted a member
                  of the <orgName>Brn's Church</orgName>, at a communion <name type="event">Lovefeast</name>
                  and having been a regular communicant in
                  <orgName>the Established Church</orgName>, she partook of the
                  Holy Sacrament at the same time. - She always
                  spoke of this as being a season of much
                  blessedness, and ever considered it a special
                  leading of our Saviour, to bring her into a

                  The following May when her respected
                  Father in law Mr. Lees was called home in such
                  an awfully sudden manner, she was generously
                  supported and enabled to speak comfort to her
                  distressed partner, leading him with much
                  tenderness and simplicity to look forward to
                  the hope set before us in the Gospel, that
                  if faithful to the end we should meet him
                  in Heaven. Our marriage was blessed in the
                  following December by the birth of a son -
                  this, with the pure air of Leominster seemed
                  to have wrought a change for the better in
                  her constitution but her gracious Saviour
                  had higher intentions for her than to
                  continue long a sojournn  soujourn in this vale of
                  tears,- the next winter she was again
                  much troubled with her cough, and
                  the medical attendant who was called in
                  to see her whilst suffering under a severe
                  attack of cold accompanied by a distressing
                  cough, gave it as his opinion, that seeds
                  of consumption had evidently been sown,
                  and were beginning to produce bad effects
                  which caused ever afterwards great anxiety in
                  the minds of all her friends.

                  The death of her sister Charlotte last
                  summer, seemed to impress upon her
                  mind the idea that it would not be
                  long before she would be called home.-
                  She suffered very much during the last
                  3 months of her pilgrimage thro' time, from
                  weakness and her violent cough, but was always cheerful, and never complained, but
                  expressed her confidence that the Saviour
                  who had hitherto supported would continue
                  to be her strength.- her married sister
                  came to stay a few weeks with her early
                  in December which was a source of great pleasure
                  to her, -her spirits and cheerfulness tho' 
                  on the eve of her confinement were particu-
                  larly noticed by all around her. When the
                  weather was not fit for her to go to Chapel,
                  and she was recommended to stay at home, 
                  her answer always was, "I am able to go, the
                  Lord blesses any soul more than the effort
                  injures my feeble frame", nor would she ever
                  miss as long as she had strength to go.
                  When her sister in law Mrs. C Lees married
                  again last January she understood her Tract

                  District and missionary subscribes in the
                  Town, and tho' often poorly, her Saviour
                  gave her strength to do his work, and 
                  she often expressed the enjoyment she had
                  in her visits among the poor, supplying
                  them with the food of eternal life, and
                  many gave her great pleasure by the
                  thankfulness with which they received the 
                  tracts. - The last day our dear sister
                  was permitted to attend the Chapel, was at
                  the Lovefeast on Christmas day, which she
                  enjoyed very much.- she was quite overcome
                  when she returned home and said "this is
                  the last time I shall go for the present." 
                  On the 29th of December, she was safely and most
                  mercifully delivered of a second son, and the
                  strong arm of the Lord was so whom her 
                  during the time of nature's trial, that she
                  spoke of it afterwards, that had she seen
                  her Saviour bodily present, she could not
                  have felt his support more  than she did.
                  The first few days she seemed to be doing
                  remarkably well, but afterwards she did not
                  gain strength, whilst of the same time

                  she lost her appetite, which she attributed
                  to a very painful affection in her and from
                  which she suffered much. The Surgeon admin-
                  istered some medicine which greatly relieved
                  her, and her anxious friends then hoped she
                  would go on well, but it was otherwise ordered,
                  for on the Thursday previous to her departure she
                  was taken with a fainting fit producing hyste-
                  rics -- by the means used she soon recovered 
                  and became comfortable again, and would insist
                  on her husband's attending the anniversary 
                  meeting of the Sunday schools which was held
                  that evening.-The next morning her medical 
                  attendant informed her friends that she was
                  suffering from severe disease on her lungs, and
                  that she was in great, tho' not immediate
                  danger, and if the disease could be kept down
                  to allow her to gain strength she might be 
                  partially restored. When it was mentioned to her
                  she exclaimed, "I am in the Lord's hands, he has
                  abundantly helped me, and if it is his will he will
                  do so now, but if not, He will take me to him
                  self tho' such a poor sinner-- Her only anxiety
                  seemed to be, that if she got better, she should

                  never be able to do much for her baby, her
                  husband and her little boy of whom she was
                  doatingly fond. She seemed according to all
                  appearances, to be gradually improving in strength,
                  during Saturday and Sunday tho' exceedingly weak,
                  and she enjoyed the company of her friends very
                  much, especially on Sunday-- On Sunday morning,
                  when the texts of the day read to her, she was 
                  much cheered and struck with the Doctrinal text,
                  from Cor: 9 ch: 26, " I therefore so pure, not as uncertainly,
                  so fight I, not as one that beateth the air".  "Help us
                  to obtain the prize, "Help us well to close our race"
                  On Monday morning, after a good night's rest, 
                  she took leave of her sister, who was obliged to 
                  return home, in the most cheerful manner,
                  and her cheerfulness throughout that day was
                  most remarkable, -- but who can understand 
                  the mysterious ways of the Almighty. - 
                  After taking her tea, setting up in her bed, 
                  which she had enjoyed very much, she fell
                  back on her pillow, apparently in a fainting
                  fit, - as long as she had strength, she gave
                  directions as to the remedies to be applied,
                  but these, and the medicines given by the

                  Doctor who was instantly called in, failed
                  of the desired effect, and in a few moments
                  the vital spark fled with scarcely a struggle, 
                  and she was wafted by Angels to those
                  heavenly mansions, prepared for her, where
                  her Saviour had prepared for her an ever
                  lasting crown, and she is now joining the 
                  blessed chorus above, singing, "Worthy is the Lamb
                  
                  that was slain"- Her childlike confidence in 
                  her Saviour, her mild and amiable disposition,
                  and esteem of all who knew her, and will
                  never be forgotten. As Wife, Sister, Friend and
                  Mother, - Where was such another?- The loss to 
                  her afflicted partner and children, can only be
                  supplied by the Gracious Father, who has taken
                  out of this role of tears this his handmaiden
                  in early life- Oh may it lead us all to place
                  our only hopes on that firm Rock on which
                  our happily departed Sister built, and in life
                  and in death put over trust in Him,
                  according to the hymn No 630, which she used
                  to delight in - "When by adversity I'm tried-
                  "In God my Rock I will confide- Midst trials what-
                  soe'er they be- Rely on his fidelity.-
