                  beautiful thing that seldom occurs in the <date when-iso="1922">world today</date> as I see it, as it is
                  forced upon me. It as simply a beautiful white flame; I met him; I had always been
                  a reserved, very retiring young girl, and he was the first man and the only man
                  who ever embodied all the glories of manhood in one private body. He represented
                  that to me. He never by look, by word or by deed gave me any reason to doubt any
                  of my ideals that were placed in him absolutely. At the time our love first
                  formulated he said to me, <quote>"Mary, this is not right. You are May and I am December,
                     and this is not right. I know it is best that we must part."</quote> This was at the very
                  beginning of it, and I said, <quote>"Of course, I don't want to do any immodest or bold
                     thing; I couldn't try to withhold a person's love for me who didn't care for me.""
                     I said, "I know that you are many years older than I, but I couldn't love anybody
                     as I love you. I simply love you."</quote> And we did try to part, We tried it again and
                  again, and then he would beoome ill. At one time I had almost resolved to see him
                  no more, and he was taken ill and nobody else cared, [page 6] really cared whether
                  he ate his dinner or whether he dressed warm1y enough, whether he took care of
                  himself, and I couldn't bear for him to suffer. It was not only a love of
                  sweetheart, but I wanted to be his nurse. I wanted to hold his head when it was
                  aching. I wanted him to tell me his mental troubles, his heart troubles, and let
                  me soothe them away for him as I would for a little child. I forgot the man's age;
                  it meant nothing to me. The only thing I wanted was to serve him as I would have
                  served the Lord or a little child, and then it just passed away; for months at a
                  time I wouldn't see him and I didn't know why. Finally, I decided there was no
                  use; it must come to an end and I went there on the night of the 23d to give him
                  <objectName>this letter</objectName> telling him "goodbye." I had reason to believe, in the awful
                  vernacular of the day, that it was over anyway, but I went there to say "goodbye"
                  myself. He said,<quote> "It is rather late, isn't it, Mary?"</quote> when he opened the door. I
                  said, <quote>"Yes, but don't you realize that I had to come to see you? You know
                     <persName>Mama</persName> has been sick for three months and you have been ill
                     and I have been frightfully worried and you haven't even had the kindness to call
                     me to tell me that you were i11 and that I must not expect to see you to tell mo
                     that things are all right."</quote></ab>
               <ab> I said, <quote>"I don't care if you don't wish to see me, because it hurts me, but it wouldn't have hurt one-millionth as much if you had just explained to me and not leave me in the dark."</quote> He said, <quote>"Mary I couldn't help it; I couldn't help it and I can't explain it to you."</quote></ab>
               <ab> Oh, I don't know! I have told this thing so many times, Mr Doran, that the words
                  just - I can't tell it even as it is; I can't even express it to you as it really
                  is. There is so much more to it.</ab>

               <ab>My last <roleName>director</roleName> was <persName>Frank Urson</persName>.
                     <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName> so often, often made the remark to me that he
                  wished tbat he were younger; he wanted to be younger. We undoubtedly would have
                  been married today and he been younger. He explained our not. being engaged in
                  that way. I knew we never could be married; I also knew I never would love for
                  another human being in the way I cared for him. So he would say, <quote>"You know,

                  marry me. I never did in my life. I couldn't do that. I never even called him
                     <persName>"Billie"</persName> in my life. The man was too wonderful for that.
                  He was wonderful. I don't care what anybody says or what they prove against him. I

                  are well known; he comes to see you, and we are always glad to receive him, but we
                  never know how long he is going to stay with us or how long he was going to stay
                  with this one or that one. He flits here and there like a swallow. We are all

               <speaker>MINTER</speaker>
               <ab>He didn't mention the subject. <quote>"May I marry you"</quote> again; he didn't
                  say that, but he has been on very friendly terms with me and then suddenly go away
                  to <placeName>San Francisco</placeName>. and I wouldn't hear from him and I would
                  remark, <quote>"Isn't that just like <persName>Marshall</persName>?"</quote> and

               <ab> No, indeed he did not; he knew that I loved <persName>Mr Taylor</persName> and
                  he had known it.</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab> No, he did not; I wouldn't have permitted him to; and I didn't comment on

               <ab> I will use the word <objectName>"quarrel,"</objectName> but that may be
                  exaggerated; did you ever quarrel with <persName>Neilan</persName> over
                     <persName>Taylor</persName>? </ab>

               <ab> Absolutely not; absolutely not. <persName>Marshall</persName> is the
                  typification of the happy-go-lucky Irish spirit and tempera­ment. He does
                  perfectly terrible things to everybody, but everybody loves him. They are always
                  glad to see him again. As to harboring any deep-seated malice, I don't believe he
                  is capable of it. </ab>

                  -- Could he have assumed at any time that he might be or was engaged to you by
                  reason of your relations wtth him? </ab>

               <speaker>MINTER: </speaker>
               <ab> Could <persName>Marshall Neilan</persName> have assumed that <persName>Mr

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN: </speaker>
               <ab> Did you ever give him the impression that he might some day be successful in his
                  effort to marry you? </ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER: </speaker>
               <ab> Not in my own knowledge. If I have, it was more or less of a joking way. I think
                  I have at times said, "Well, <persName>Marshall</persName>, when are we going all
                  around the world on our honey-moon?" exactly in the same manner as I took him to
                  say, "Now, when you are my wedded bride we will do" so-and­-so.
                     <persName>Marshall</persName> has done that time after time. </ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker> MINTER: </speaker>
               <ab> I don't think so.</ab>

            <sp>

               <ab> No, I don't know that he did not.</ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DORAN:</speaker>
               <ab> Don't you know that he was really -- Don't you feel that he was really in love
                  with you?</ab>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab> I can't truthfully answer "Yes" or "no" to that, beoause I don't know; I am not
                  sure enough of <persName>Mr Neilan's</persName> nature. While I have known him a
                  great many years, well, I will say I have known him several years, he is the type
                  who flits back and forth, you know. - When you really think you know him he turns
                  to something else, and I don't know, so I have never permitted myself to form any
                  conclusions on his character; I don't know whether he has ever taken me seriously
                  or not. I always treated him more or less in a joking manner.</ab>

               <ab> Why, he communicated with me; he tried to, but it was because of me he did that.
                  On <date>Thuraday night</date> I was worried about <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>;
                  I was worried about <persName>Mr Neilan</persName> and called <persName>Marshall's

                  call me. He had not called me in three weeks or more. 1 thought no more about it and
                  I was surprised the next day to learn -- yes, <date>Friday</date> -- that he had tried to get
                  me at <time>five-thirty</time>. My <persName>sister</persName> was at our <placeName>old home</placeName> where there is a <objectName>telephone</objectName>. The

                  back. He said well, he wanted me to come to see him <time>before ten o'clock</time>, but <time>after
                     ten o'clock</time> he would be on location. He didn't say the <placeName>Salt Lake Station</placeName>, but he

                  they all told me l had better call <persName>Marshall</persName>; he seemed very anxious to get hold of
                  me. I didn't· know where to call him; I thought possibly he would come to the
                  <placeName>house</placeName>. I waited for him awhile and he didn't come, and finally <persName>grand­mother</persName> said,
                  <quote> "<persName>Dearie</persName>, If I were you I would call him up or at least call <persName>his mother</persName> and find
                     out where he is."</quote> I called the <placeName>studio</placeName> and the <persName>night watchman</persName> immediately said, <quote>"<persName>Mr

                  been working <time>all night</time> tor <date>four nights past</date>. They were all just dead tired.
                  Night and day they had been working. He finished about <time>two-thirty</time>, and then there
                  were several in the party, <persName>Gloria Swanson</persName>, <persName>Jack Pickford</persName>, <persName>Frank Urson</persName> --<persName> Mr Frank
                     Urson</persName> is now associated with <persName>Mr Neilan</persName> as director -- and <persName>Marshall</persName> and myself. We
                  went to <placeName>his mother's home</placeName> where he lives with his mother and we tried to make <objectName>eggs</objectName>
                  and things. It was very amusing; we only had four <objectName>eggs</objectName>, and I tried to fry two of
                  them and ruined the things, adn we didn't have enough to go around and we made so
                  much noise his mother, who was ill upstairs, told us we must behave ourselves.
                  <persName>Marshall</persName> said, <quote>"There is only one thing to do; I have got to talk to you. We have

               <ab> We left location, he worked down at the <placeName>Salt Lake Station</placeName>, about <time when-iso= "02:30">two-thirty to a
                  quarter to three</time>, we left there and went to <placeName>his house</placeName>. How long we were there I
                  couldn't say; I didn't have a <objectName>watch</objectName>; I imagine we were there about an hour or
                  maybe more, and then we went on down to the <placeName>studio</placeName> and we stayed until <time>dawn</time>,
                  whatever time that is. We then came on back to <placeName>my house</placeName>. <persName>Mother</persName> was waiting for us
                  and we got out and explained to her. <persName>Mother</persName> knew he had had a verious talk and she
                  felt sure <persName>Marhsall</persName> would try to come to our aid. My <persName>mother</persName> is very fond of <persName>Mr
                     Neilan</persName> and the whole family. He said he was just dead tired. The man took his
                  hours when hee needed sleep to tell me these things. He was going to be up at
                  <time when-iso= "08:00"> eight o'clock </time> that morning and he didn't even go to <objectName>bed</objectName> that night. He just sat up
                  in his <objectName>clothes</objectName> and went out to work again at <time when-iso= "08:00"> eight o'clock </time>. Anyway, he said, "I
                  tried to get your <objectName type="communication">letters</objectName> for you. You know they are a very important factor in
                  the case, if they get hold of them." I was shocked to find that he knew of my
                  <objectName type= "communication">letters</objectName>. I said that I wrote some, and he said something about going to a
                  <objectName>newspaper</objectName> or getting hold of some body in <placeName>Pasadena</placeName> to get me the <objectName type= "communication">letters</objectName>. That
                  part is not clear in my mind. I think I was so tired at the time I couldn't
                  understand him. I haven't seen him since or I would have questioned him again
                  about the <objectName type= "communication">letters</objectName> just what he did. He told me I should have received them that
                  day. He asked me if I had gotten them and I said, "No, I haven't received the
                  <objectName type= "communication">letters</objectName> today." He said, "Well, I sent them to the <placeName>studio</placeName>, and I believe the
                  <placeName> studio</placeName>," the <placeName>Realart Studio</placeName> where I had last worked. He said, "They are in Charley
                  <persName>Eyton's</persName> hands now." He either said <persName>Charley Eyton</persName> or <persName>Mr Carbut</persName>, but I can't state
                  this acutally because I was so tired at the time I could hardly hear him and I was
                  desperately interested to hear what he said about the <objectName type= "communication">letter</objectName>, and I strained all
                  my nerves to hear, but instead it came back and forth; it was hazy. I don't know
                  the exact words he spoke. Anyway, I remember saying, "Well, there is nothing in
                  the <objectName type= "communication">letters</objectName> that the world can't read except that it is horribly painful to me to
                  have them read my <objectName>letters</objectName> to him." He said, "You loved <persName>Billie</persName>, didn't you?" I
                  said, "Yes, <persName>Marshall</persName>, I loved him deeply and sincerely." And he said, "Did you
                  ever want to marry him?" Whereupon I replied, I said, "No, no; I know it couldn't
                  have been. It was not meant to be." Then we talked about -- Oh, yes. Then he said,
                  "Now, <persName>Mary</persName>, I am going to tell you some very important thing; they are going to
                  hurt you, going to shock you, but before I say a word I want you to consider
                  <persName> Billie</persName> was just as crazy as a March hare months before his death." He said, "I am
                  going to recite a few instances that <persName>Bill</persName> told me about, things irrelevant to you,
                  to show he didn't do this only to you but to others of his very best friends." </ab>
               
               <ab>Marshall and <persName>Mr Taylor</persName> were extremely good friends. I don't think they saw each
                  other often, but they were most affectionately fond of each other. He said, "On
                  several occasions <persName>Bill</persName>" -- he spoke of him as '<persName>Bill</persName>' -- "has confessed to me that
                  -- Oh, I am so tired I can't think how I am trying­ to say it. He came up to my
                  room in the <placeName>club</placeName> one day and he said, "Oh, I know something about you, <persName>Marshall</persName>,
                  and those gold-tipped <objectName>cigarettes</objectName> I found of yours." Whereupon <persName>Marshall</persName> said he
                  replied, "Well, you needn't say anything, Bill" -- l don't know what it was, a
                  <objectName>cigar</objectName> or something of some personal nature that he recognized of <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>'s at
                  <placeName>somebody's house</placeName>. I don't know whose house. He said, "That makes us Elks. Don't
                  you say anything about me, what I have been doing in a joking, friendly manner."
                  <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>, he said, suddenly stood up and looked at him very seriously, soberly,
                  and said, "<persName>Marshall</persName>, I am surprised at the things you are doing now-a-days."
                  <persName>Marshall</persName> said, "Just what do you mean by that?" and he said, "Why, what you said
                  to your <persName>wife</persName> the other night at <time>Sunset</time> Inn about poor little <persName>Gloria Swanson</persName>."</ab>

               <ab>I may be getting some of those words mixed; maybe he didn't say "poor little
                  <persName ref="#Swanson">Gloria Swanson</persName>." Maybe <persName ref="#Neilon">Marshall</persName> didn't tell me that. This is my impression.
                  <persName ref="#Neilan">Marshall</persName> said, "What do you mean?" And he said, "Don't you remember the night we
                  were at <placeName>Sunset Inn</placeName> and you were sitting here and <persName ref="#Swansan">Miss Swanson</persName> was sitting there
                  and your former wife, <persName ref="#Banbrick">Gertrude Banbrick</persName>, came in and said, 'Hello, <persName ref="#Swanson">Gloria</persName>, how are
                  you?' and <persName ref="#Swanson">Gloria</persName> replied pleasantly, and you turned to <persName ref="#Bambrick">Gertrude Bambrick</persName> and said,
                  'How dare you speak to this girl?' pointing to <persName ref="#Swanson">Gloria</persName>, the lady he was with, 'How
                  dare you speak to her? Don't you ever dare to speak to her again,'" And <persName ref="#Taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>
                  was telling <persName ref="#Neilan">Marshall Neilan</persName>. <persName ref="#Neilan">Marshall</persName> said he looked at him and said, "What's the
                  matter with you, <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill</persName>? Are you drunk?" He said, I haven't had a drink," <persName ref="#Taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>
                  said, and he said, "The funny part of it was he wasn't drunk." He couldn't detect
                  it on his breath. "But he looked quite as serious and sober as I do this minute."
                  He said, "Why, tell me what day you think this was." He said it was on a certain
                  day -- I don't know if <persName ref="#Neilan">Marshall</persName> told me the day or not. He said, on a certain day
                  at <placeName>Sunset Inn</placeName> recently. <persName ref="#Neilan">Marshall</persName> said, "Why, <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill</persName>, at that time l I was in <placeName>New
                     York City</placeName> and was not in <placeName>Los Angeles</placeName> nor <placeName>California</placeName>." <persName ref="#Taylor">Mr Taylor</persName> and he had quite a
                  friendly argument over it, and he said, "I know it is so; I was there myself and
                  heard what you said upon this greeting between those two girls." <persName ref="#Neilan">Marshall</persName> said he
                  thought perhaps he had lost his mind. The next day he called up, haVing that in
                  mind, <persName ref="#Swanson">Miss Swanson</persName> and he said, "<persName ref="#Swanson">Gloria</persName>, am I going crazy? Have I lost my mind? Do
                  you remember of ever being at Sunset Inn with me when Gertrude Bambrick passed our
                  table and spoke to us pleasantly and railed at my former wife for having spoken to
                  you pleasantly and told her not to speak to you again?" And she said, "What on
                  earth are you talking about? What is this? I don't understand you," And he said,
                  "Do you ever remember seeing <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill Taylor</persName> there near us at any time on any such
                  occasion?" And she said, "Certainly not, !the oniy time I ever saw <persName ref="#Taylor">William Taylor</persName>
                  at <placeName>Sunset Inn</placeName> was the night I was with" -- I don't know his name, some friend of
                  hers -- "and <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill Taylor</persName> was sitting away over on the other side by the wall and
                  we were by the orchestra on this side." He said, "Was I there?" And she said, "No.
                  Don't you remember you were in <placeName>New York</placeName> at the time?" He said, "That is one
                  instance, <persName ref="#Minter">Mary</persName>, of <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill's</persName> failing mind, I have never cleared that up. <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill</persName> and I
                  have discussed it many times since, and I have always gone away puzzled, amazed,
                  that he still stuck to his version of my having spoken to my former wife as I did.
                  I didn't see her; neither <persName ref="#Swanson">Miss Swanson</persName> saw her on that occasion." Then he said,
                  "On another occasion <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill</persName> told me he had received a <objectName ref="#letter">letter</objectName> from <persName ref="#Sweet">Blanche Sweet</persName>;
                  that she told <persName ref="#Taylor">Mr Taylor</persName> that she was grieved he was sick;" that <persName ref="#Neilon">Marshell Neilan</persName>
                  was calling on me and she intended to sue him. <persName ref="#Neilan">Marshall</persName> said that sounded so
                  unlike <persName ref="#Sweet">Miss Sweet</persName> that he went to her and questioned her, and he said, "<persName ref="#Sweet">Blanche</persName>,
                  have you writtn to <persName ref="#Taylor">Bill</persName> lately?" She said, "Why, yes, I wrote him a little <objectName ref="#letter">note</objectName>
                  not so long ago thanking him for some poinsettias he sent me <date>Christmas</date>." He aa1d,
                  "Did you say anything else?" She said, "No, not that I can remember." He said,
                  "Did you ever say that you regretted my going about with <persName ref="#Minter">Miss Minter</persName> and that you
                  intended to sue me?" She said, "Perfectly ridiculous. What do you mean? I
                  certainly did not say any such thing."

                  game. I have heard that hundreds of times myself; I am pretty sure it is so."</quote> He
                  said, "Now, that is another instance of poor <persName>Bill's</persName> insanity. Now, <persName>Mary</persName>, here is
                  the ghastly thing I have to tell you." He said, "One time" -- I don't know whether
                  he said in his <placeName>room</placeName> or the <placeName>club</placeName>, he was somewhere, I think in one of his own
                  rooms, he, <persName>Marshall Nieilan</persName>, and <persName>Arthur Hoyt</persName>, <persName>Cap Robinson</persName> -- He said <persName>"Cap
                     Robinson</persName>"; maybe he meant "Captain"; I don't know; I don't know how he is; I know
                  <persName>Arthur</persName> well. He said, "We were all standing around there talking pleasantly" -- I
                  think he said <persName>Antonio Moreno</persName> was there. He said, "We were all talking pleasantly
                  and <persName>Mr Taylor</persName> suddenly started talking about you, and the talk grew finally more
                  and more personal and finally he said -- and this is terrible -- 'presently he
                  said you had been over in the <time>last two weeks</time>" -- I should say this is within at
                  least <time>three weeks</time> of <persName>Mr Taylor's</persName> death; I think Marshall told me at the time, but
                  I have forgotten the time. -- "within the last <time>two weeks</time>, that you were undressed
                  in his <placeName>apartments</placeName>; that you beseeched him for his love; that he resisted you, and
                  finally persuaded you to leave his <placeName>apartment</placeName>s."</ab>
               <ab> Marshall said that to me, and looked right at me. I could feel myself grow red.
                  I said, "Is that all you have to tell me about Mr Taylor?" He said, "Well, I could
                  recite some more instances about Bill's seeming insanity." He said, "I am certain
                  he was insane. He stood up and told those things as soberly as I am talking to you
                  now." </ab>

               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab>Yes, he said he was drunk at the time. <persName>Marshall</persName> has told <persName>ma</persName> on several occasions,
                  sometimes long ago and sometimes recently that he always hated to see <persName>Bill</persName> drink
                  because he said, "You wouldn't know the man; he changes so; he gets maudlin and
                  silly, smiles in a foolish manner and wobbles and talks, oh, just the silly,
                  foolish things." He said, "None of his friends like to see him drink." At this
                  time he was intoxicated and he talked on and on and on about this thing." <persName>Marshall</persName>
                  said he got up and he told <persName>Bill</persName>, "You are insane; something 1s the matter with
                  your mind. I would certainly take more vengeance on you if I didn't think you were
                  crazy," and that was tbe opinion of <persName>Arthur Hoyt</persName> and <persName>Cap Robinson</persName> and <persName>everybody</persName>.
                  They were perfectly amazed that a man of <persName>Mr Taylor's</persName> lovable, sweet, considerate,
                  gentlemanly disposition all through life should suddenly turn around and say this
                  about not only a woman, but about me, whom they all knew he admired and respected. </ab>
               <ab>When I heard of this thing, l just looked to <persName>Marshall</persName> and said, "Is that all you
                  have to tell me about Mr Taylor?" And he said, "Yes, that is all. That 1s the
                  ghastly <objectName>thing</objectName>. I know you are going to hear this from somebody and I wanted you to
                  hear it from me, and want to find out what you knew about the murder of this man." </ab>
               <ab> By this time I was getting -- Oh, how can I can I express it? -- just exhausted
                  with shock, one shock after another and of all the <objectName>shocks</objectName> I had received, this
                  coming from hlm who I had no reason to doubt his word, I couldn't believe it; not
                  as I knew <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>, I couldn't believe for an instant he had ever said these
                  things to anybody, yet there <persName>Marshall</persName> giving me names, dates and places. The thing
                  was too much for me. I got furious; and I said, "I don't believe you! I think you
                  are lying! How dare you say this about him to me! I never want to see you again?"
                  He got up and walked around the room for a minute and I was just broiling; I was
                  just furious; and he turned around and he said, "Well, Mary, some day you will
                  realize that I certainly am not saying this for any personal reason. It hurts me
                  as it must hurt you. I am simply telling you because you are bound to know it; it
                  is the truth and I wanted to be the one to tell you. </ab>

                  conversation didn't come as quickly as I am te11ing it to you. It came with long
                  pauses; he would get up and walk around with his <objectName type="accessories">cigarette</objectName> smoking and come back
                  again and go out and talk to the property man, go out of <placeName>the office</placeName>, and I would

                  go<placeName> home</placeName>. I said, <quote> "Why keep sitting up? You have got to get up at <time when-iso= "8:30:00"> eight o'clock in

                  thought I knew something about it, and he looked at me and he said, <quote> "Now,<persName ref="#Mary"> Mary"</persName> </quote> --
                  he got a little profane, he said, <quote> "Now, <persName ref="#Mary">Mary,</persName> for God's sake, if you know anything

                  words about pro and con, trying to think, and I thought over everyrody I knew and
                  I said this, more or less in a humourous way, I said, <quote> "The only person I know who
                     could have had a possible motive for killing him would be <persName ref="#Ivers"> Mrs. Julia Crawford 
                        Ivers."</persName> </quote> I was not serious when I said that. I was more or less humorous. She is a
                  lady I feel I ought to explain about, who has never done me a wrong thing in her
                  life and I have never done her a wrong thing, either, but she is a Christian
                  Science lady who has been associated with him as a scenario writer for many years;
                  she is quite a trusted, lovely woman, I am sure; a very honorable respectable
                  woman, but we don't like eaeh other. There is no reason, but we don't like each
                  other. Every time I wanted to see him, somehow she would be there and she had a
                  strange way of treating me. She would say, Oh yes, there is <persName ref="#Mary">little Mary.</persName> Here she
                  comes." She would go on in this manner, <quote> "Oh, there is <persName ref="#Mary">little Mary</persName> again, Oh, there
                     she is; wbat can she be want1ng this time? Oh, yes, uh huh."</quote>  Quite a strange
                  attitude, She just riled me. </ab>

               <ab select="statement">MINTER: She must have been 50. Her son was <persName ref='Taylor'>Mr Taylor's</persName>
                  camera man. <persName ref='Vantrees'>Jimmy</persName> was my camera man,
                  <persName ref='Vantrees'>Jim Vantrees</persName>. I don't hate the woman, but she annoys me.
                  She is one of the few people in the world I dislike to see. In fact, the irony of
                  fate it was when I was in <placeName>France</placeName> after looking at the
                  beautifUl Venus de Muile in <placeName>Paris</placeName> at the Louvre, and after
                  I had walked a few steps done a long hall, thinking of this excellent statue, who
                  should I see but <persName ref='Ivers'>Julia Crawford Ivers</persName>, a very, fat, large
                  woman. She did some more of these Christian Science things, and she had a very
                  unpleasant habit of whenever she would be with me and <persName ref='Taylor'>Mr
                     Taylor</persName>, she would always come and twit my chin. So I said, in really
                  a joking manner -- I don't want to accuse the woman, because I don't think she had
                  anything to do with the matter -- I said <quote>"I don't know anyone who would
                     kill him but <persName ref='Ivers'>Ju1ia Crawford Ivers</persName>."</quote>
                  <quote>"I always suspected the woman of being in love with him herself or she
                     might have killed him for that reason."</quote> He said, <quote>"My goodness!
                        You mustn't say that out loud; somebody will believe you."</quote> I said,
                  <quote>"I don't care if they do."</quote> I was in such a wild mood, Then, --
                  What else did we talk about? Oh! He talked about his
                  <objectName>productions</objectName><!-- @Devin - interesting ... we should talk about how constructs and objects play together. I've removed @type "Film" for now, but we can revisit --> and said, <quote>"I certainly have a
                     terrible time, working <time>day</time> and <time>night</time> and a great deal
                     depended upon <date>Saturday</date> and we must get certain work finished <time>Friday</time>."</quote> We
                  talked of <date>Friday</date>
                  <time>night</time> and that he had to get up at <time when-iso='8:00:00'>eight o'clock</time>; he
                  wasn't going to <objectName type='furniture'>bed</objectName> at all; that the boys were calling
                  for him at <time when-iso='8:00:00'>eight o'clock</time>, he said, and he knew if they didn't call he
                  would never get up out of his slumbers. They were going somewhere on
                  <placeName>location</placeName>, I understood, possibly at the
                  <placeName>studio</placeName>. He was just going <placeName>home</placeName>
                  and take a <placeName>shower</placeName>, get a shave if he felt like it, and go
                  on back and work some more. He said, <quote>"I am dog tired. I was never so
                     exhausted, just dead."</quote> Finally I said, <quote>"Do you rea1ize this
                        looks awful, being here all this time?"</quote> And he said, <quote>"I can't
                           help it if it does. I had to tell you these things and wanted to find out what
                           you knew about this case. That I know you knew <persName ref='Bill'>Bill</persName> very
                           well, probably better than any of us and"</quote> -- Oh, yes. He also asked me
                  to tel1 him my feelings toward <persName ref='Taylor'>Mr Taylor</persName>, exactly what
                  everybody has been asking me, and I told him as I have been telling you, I loved
                  him deeply, sincerely and absolutely; that I loved him truly, loved him in an
                  all-around way, I cared for his health; his health came before my happiness and
                  when he was ill -- and he didn't like to see anyone when he was ill-- my natural
                  impulse was to go to him and be with him and sit up night after night with him, if
                  necessary. l didn't do it; I didn t even attempt to, because he didn't want me to,
                  and although I had sat in the dark, not knowing anything and worrying about it, I
                  did that rather than intrude myself upon him when he didn't want me.</ab>

               <ab>Why, about this thing about <persName ref="#taylor_william">Mr Taylor</persName> and then also I was rather peeved at
                  <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> at the time because I hadn't heard from him in weeks. "Peeved" is hardly
                  the word. That sounds more as if I am interested in <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName>, and I am; I like
                  him, but l wasn't caring particularly; I simply said, <quote>"Well, <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName>, it was not
                     a very nice thing the way you ran off the last time. I understood they were going
                     out to dinner and you were coming to <placeName>my house</placeName> to dinner and suddenly you went to
                     <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> without so much as a fare-thee-well."</quote>' He said, <quote>"You know I do those
                        things."</quote> I said, <quote>"Yes, you do those things, and it ts very annoying, but your
                           friends love you and love you yet in spite of those funny little tricks you do,
                           darting here and there. I don't know, I am in no mood to take this foolishness; I
                           want good wholesome friendship, but I want to know when you are going to appear."</quote>
                  Many times a whole dinner has gotten cold waiting for him. When we had a dinner
                  party at <placeName>our house</placeName>, or other people have given parties, they have waited on
                  <persName ref="#neilan_marshall">Marshall</persName> for <time>two or three hours</time> and he finally would come along smiling sweetly at
                  everybody and they couldn't scold him. I was more or less taking him to task for
                  his 1ife in general, saying he should not do those things; it was very annoying
                  and I was not going to put up with it. He was sweet and Irish and said, <quote>"You
                     wouldn't be angry with me?"</quote> And I said, <quote>"No, I wouldn't be."</quote> That is the way we
                  got out of that. There was nothing serious in the talk, Just the way we always
                  talked. </ab>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MINTER:</speaker>
               <ab>Finally he said, <quote>"Now, I have got something very important to tell you, something
                  that is going to hurt your feelings terribly, but I must tell you; we wi11 go in
                  <placeName>the studio</placeName> and talk."</quote> Our teeth were chatter1ng with cold and we went in there and
                  he turned on the steam and I sat in this <objectName>fur coat</objectName> in a <objectName>wicker chair</objectName>, and he said,
                  <quote>"This is going to b, a nine or "nineteen-days talk of the world"</quote> Then he told me
                  all the things I have been telling you. There may have been some more, and some
                  thlngs I have said may not be exactly accurate, but the gist of the thing is

               <ab>Yes, and then he would dart away again. I mean he would call me up -- He can't call

                  would not hear from him for two or <time>three weeks</time>. As I said to him in the <objectName>car</objectName>, not
                  particularly about that but about other things, about dinner engagements, about &amp;

               <ab>Yes. This night for the time being, I was furious [missing page] [...] <persName>Mr
                  Neilan</persName> -- <persName>Taylor's</persName>, and at the time of
                  <persName>Mr Taylor's</persName> death, <persName>Harry</persName> was the
                  <roleName>assistant director</roleName> in <persName>Mr Taylor's</persName> companies there, and he had
                  said <persName>Harry</persName> had been in the <placeName>room</placeName> looking over the effects -- Just
                  a minute. I wonder if <persName>Charles Maigne</persName> told me this. I think
                  <persName>Mr Neilan</persName> told me this, too, that <persName>Harry</persName>
                  bad gotten the <objectName>letters</objectName> and taken them to <persName>Jim Vantrees</persName>, the
                  <roleName><objectName>camera</objectName> man</roleName>, whereupon I remarked, <quote>"I will bet <persName>Mrs Ivers</persName>
                     had them,"</quote> and I think he said, <quote>"<persName>Jim</persName> gave them
                        to <persName>Mr Eyton</persName>,"</quote> and that <persName>Mr Eyton</persName>
                  turned some of them over to the Examiner. I am so afraid l am telling things that are
                  not so here, <persName>Mr Doran</persName>; I don't mean to, but I couldn't get all
                  of it. That is as clear as I can make it. Anyway, I do remember this part, he said he
                  heard about them, and I don't know how he heard about them, and that he went down, I
                  believe, to the Examiner, to get ahold of them and he had something to do with
                  <placeName>Pasadena</placeName>, a man, he did tell me the man's name. I don't remember his name, but I
                  believe it be­gan with "S", and this man, <persName>Marshall</persName> said he was
                  the big man over the entire Examiner force, told him to go down and take the <objectName>letters</objectName>.
                  He said, <quote>"Of course, if you breathe this it wi11 just about throw me in <placeName>jail</placeName>
                     for the rest of my life,"</quote> but I don't believe it will. Then he said,
                  <quote>"Didn't you get them today?"</quote> I said, <quote>"I did not."</quote> As
                  well as I remember, <persName>Marshall</persName> said, <quote>"I then sent them to
                     the <placeName>Realart Studio</placeName> and they ought to be in <persName>Charley's</persName> hands
                     now or Mr Garbut."</quote> This whole <date>Friday night</date> is most hasy in my
                  recollection.</ab>

               <ab> No, I did not, because at the time, when I asked him if he suspected me of
                  killing <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>, we had that out; he assured me he didn't suspect any such
                  thing, but he was very much impressed with the gravity of the situation. In fact,
                  evidently he knew at that time exactly how these things were going to turn out. I
                  mean that they would drag everybody's name into it; that the papers could get hold
                  of for the notoriety of it. He said, "This involves picture people and you know
                  how <persName>Hearst</persName> hates the picture people. <persName>Hearst</persName> would do anything &amp; could if he
                  thought you did know <persName>Mr Taylor</persName>," "There are lots of prominent people in the
                  profession who knew him and loved him. They are certainly going to drag your name
                  into it." </ab>

               <ab> I was at <placeName>home</placeName> reading the <objectName>Cruise of the Kewa</objectName>. It is a humorous <objectName>book</objectName>; it is
                  really a travesty of <persName>Frederick O'Brien's</persName> stories of the South Seas. It is very
                  funny, and I laid there laughing all the <time>evening</time>. I was very -- right while I was
                  laying on the <objectName>couch</objectName> reading aloud to <persName>mother</persName> and sister and we were all laughing
                  heartily at that time, and at the same time <persName>Mr Taylor</persName> was being murdered. It seems
                  very horrible to me. </ab>

               <speaker> MINTER: </speaker>
               <ab> Let me see. I don't remember any. Possibly <persName>Mr Stockdale</persName>, he generally did, or
                  maybe somebody dropped in. I don't just remember. Usually every evening somebody
                  drops [page 40] in. I know they were not there at the time I was reading the book.

            <sp>
               <speaker> MINTER: </speaker>
               <ab> Yes, unless I put my <objectName>car</objectName> in the garage called the <placeName>Standard Garage</placeName>. I leave it
                  there sometimes, the <placeName>Standard Garage</placeName> on <placeName>Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue</placeName>.
                  Sometimes when my girl friends stop with me and have her <objectName>car</objectName>, I would move out and
                  put it in this garage and maybe wouldn't call for it for several days. I haven't
                  been feeling well for some time; I have had bronchitis. I hadn't gotten well when
                  this awful shock came to me, and I haven't used the little car very much.</ab>

                  a little child. I speak words mechanically. I sit, sleep, get up, walk and dress,
                  and I don't see exactly what I am doing." </ab>
